🎯 OBJECTIVE

Collect cards during the game.
Points are counted only at the end.
The player with the highest total points wins.

🧩 SETUP

Place all cards face down in the Circle (draw pile)

Place several cards face up in the Middle

Each player has a side area for collected cards

There are 2 Jokers total in the game

🔵 HOW TO PLAY (ON YOUR TURN)
1️⃣ Pick a card

Tap or click the Circle to pick up one card

2️⃣ Use that card to capture

You may capture cards from the Middle in either way:

✅ MATCH

Pick one middle card with the same number

➕ ADD

Pick two middle cards

If their total equals the card you picked, you capture them

📌 Important

You must see the add or match yourself

If you miss one and end your turn, you cannot go back

3️⃣ Keep going or stop

If you successfully capture:

You pick again from the Circle

Your turn continues

If you cannot add or match:

Your turn ends immediately

Play moves to the next player

🃏 JOKER RULE (VERY IMPORTANT)

There are only 2 Jokers in the game.

When a player picks a Joker from the Circle:

They immediately collect:

✅ All cards collected by every other player

✅ All cards currently in the Middle

❌ Cards still in the Circle stay there
❌ Joker does not end the game automatically

🧠 Joker is powerful, but timing matters.

🛑 END OF THE GAME

The game ends when the last card is picked from the Circle

If there are cards left in the Middle at that moment:

The player who picked the last Circle card collects them all

Then, score the game.

🧮 SCORING (END OF GAME ONLY)

Count the cards each player collected:

Number cards (1–10) → 1 point each

Face cards (J, Q, K) → 10 points each

Jokers → 1 point each

🏆 The player with the most points wins

⚠️ IMPORTANT RULES TO REMEMBER

Side cards are locked unless taken by a Joker

Only the Middle can be added or matched

No helping, no reminders, no take-backs

Miss it on your turn → it’s gone

🧠 ONE-LINE SUMMARY (KID VERSION)

“Pick from the circle, add or match from the middle, Jokers shake everything up, and the biggest score at the end wins.”
